        <h2 id="section1" >The Origin of the Turkish Language</h2>
        <h3>Historical Background</h3>
        <p> The Turkish language is a member of the Turkic language family, which belongs to the Altaic language group. Its origins trace back to the Central Asian steppes, around 5000–8000 years ago. </p>
        <h3> First Speakers and Their Lives</h3>
            <p>The earliest speakers of proto-Turkic languages were nomadic tribes in Central Asia. These tribes lived in areas 
            around the Altai Mountains and Siberia. Their lifestyle was primarily nomadic, involving herding, hunting, and trading.
             They were known for their use of horses and their expertise in metallurgy, particularly in crafting weapons and tools. 
             These people had strong oral traditions, with early Turkic inscriptions, 
            such as the Orkhon inscriptions (8th century), marking some of the oldest written records.</p>

    <h2 id="section2" >Language, Science, and Innovation</h2>
        <h3> The Science of Language</h3>
        <p>Contributions to Science and Innovation
            The Turkish language and scholars have contributed to various fields of science:
            Ulugh Beg: A 15th-century Turkic astronomer and mathematician.
            Taqi al-Din: An Ottoman-era polymath who made significant advancements in astronomy and engineering.
            <h3>Language Innovations</h3>
            <p>The language underwent a script reform in 1928, transitioning from the Arabic script to the Latin alphabet under
            Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. This made the language easier to learn and fostered literacy.</p>
