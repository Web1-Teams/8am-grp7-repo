        <h2 id="section1" >The Origin of the Spanish Language</h2>
        <h3>The Spanish language</h3>
        <p> originates from the Iberian Peninsula, evolving from Vulgar Latin after the fall of the Roman Empire. The first people to speak a precursor to modern Spanish were the Romans, who brought Latin to the Iberian Peninsula during their conquest (218 BCE – 5th century CE). Latin merged with local languages, such as Celtiberian and Basque, to create regional dialects, including Castilian.
            
            By the 9th century, Castilian emerged as a distinct dialect in the region of Castile, modern-day northern Spain. During the Reconquista (the centuries-long process of reclaiming Iberia from Moorish rule), Castilian incorporated many words from Arabic due to Moorish influence (711–1492 CE). The first written records of Spanish, including the "Glosas Emilianenses," date back to the 10th century.
            
            The culture and lifestyle of early Spanish-speaking peoples reflected a blend of Roman urban organization, Moorish scientific advancements, and medieval European feudal traditions. They were predominantly agricultural, with a growing focus on trade, craftsmanship, and scholarly pursuits during the later Middle Ages.</p>

            Medieval Moorish Spain:
            
            The Moors established Spain as a hub of learning, particularly in Córdoba. Scholars like Averroes and Maimonides contributed to medicine, astronomy, and philosophy.
            Age of Exploration:
            
            Spain's maritime advancements were critical during the 15th and 16th centuries. Figures like Christopher Columbus (sponsored by Spain) and Amerigo Vespucci made groundbreaking geographical discoveries.
            Modern Innovations:
            
            Santiago Ramón y Cajal, a pioneering neuroscientist, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for his work on the structure of the nervous system.
            Spain has made contributions to renewable energy technology, aerospace engineering, and biotechnology in recent years.</p>
