     <div class="Origin">
        <h2 id="section1"> Origin of the French Language</h2>
        <p>The French language is a Romance language that evolved from Vulgar Latin, spoken by the Roman Empire's population. It began to take shape during the early Middle Ages (around the 9th century) in what is now France. </p>
        <h3>First People to Speak French:</h3>
        <p> The earliest speakers of Old French were the inhabitants of the northern regions of modern-day France. These areas were inhabited by the Gauls (a Celtic people) before Roman conquest in 58–50 BCE. After the Roman invasion,  the region became Romanized, adopting Latin as the dominant language. Over time, Latin mixed with local Celtic languages and the Germanic languages of the Franks (a tribe that invaded during the early Middle Ages), giving rise to Old French.</p>
        <h3>Nature of Their Lives and Culture:</h3>
        <p> The early speakers of French were largely agrarian, living in small villages and engaging in farming and local trade
        With Roman influence, urban centers emerged, along with advancements in engineering, architecture, and education. Christianity played a significant role, shaping cultural and intellectual life.
         Medieval French culture was heavily influenced by chivalric values, feudalism, and the early development of art and literature.</p>
